This is a tool to load memory images onto the memSIM2 EPROM emulator
from momik.pl .

Building:
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install
memSIM -h

Should build on Linux out of the box.
Other UN*X may needs some modifications. The are some Linux-specific hacks to make the serial port run at 460800bps.
